# Targets


<strong>Abstract /Game Overview 20</strong>

Targets is a paintball based FPS target shooting game. The goal of the game is to hit as many targets as you possibly can within the time frame. Points shall be awarded for each target hit and bonus points with each consecutive target hit within a few seconds. There will be stationary targets as well as moving ones, the moving ones will award greater amounts of points then the stationary ones.

<strong>Gameplay Description (puzzles, missions, progression, etc.) 50</strong>

The basis of the gameplay is to hit all the targets before the timer runs out, there will be a progression based level systems where the target will get harder to hit. The first level will only have stationary targets and a generous amount of time. The second level will have a mixture of both stationary target and moving targets and the third will have only moving targets. Beat all three level to progress through the game and finish it.

<strong>Gameplay Mechanics (engine, physics, movement, inventory, actions, etc.) 80</strong>

The game will be built using Unreal Engine 4. Classic FPS physics will apply to the game, such as bullet drop/gravity, friction (i.e. the player’s connection to the ground), etc. Player movement is a standard walking style. Bullet drop is more extensive than usual, to emulate a paintball vs. your classic bullet that wouldn’t have as much drop. Some randomly generated targets have moving properties, however gravity will not be present for these targets as they will just move from side to side. The game doesn’t have an inventory system. Basic actions apply, shooting to interact with targets, and the ability to open some doors using the interact button ‘E’.

<strong>Story, Setting, Character & Game World (storyboard, game world description, etc.) 60</strong>

The story is based on Robert Knight, Rob’s dream is to become a member of the JTF2 (Joint Task Force 2) in the Canadian Military. This is an elite group of specialists working alongside the Canadian Special Operations Regiment in classified, highly dangerous missions. Starting out very young, Robert wants to practice his marksmanship but only has a paintball gun to use. You play as Robert, practicing shooting targets in an abandoned factory in Northern BC. Using his technological abilities, he’s created a target system for himself to randomly drop targets and have them move slightly to test his abilities. The game world is a single map, which takes place in an abandoned factory. The factory is limited to natural light, due to the lack of power running in the factory. The concrete is old and cracked, allowing wildlife to take over the building. There are some windows, most are broken. There are old lamps that used to provide light for the building, no longer functional. This is a modern-time world, assuming the factory was built about 200 years ago and has since degraded from weather and lack of upkeep.

<strong>Interface (camera, menus, hud, audio, music, etc.) 50</strong>

Like a typical FPS the game is played as your were the player. The camera is based in the head of the player as you maneuver around the map. The game will not have any menu systems, as so as you launch the game you will be briefed on your mission and throughn into action. There will be simple audio features, such as guns fire and a success sounds when you hit a target. There will be a some background music during the game to excite the player. 

<strong>Artificial Intelligence (collision detection, opponents, npcs, etc.) 20</strong>

At this point we don’t have any opponents/enemies, but the “Enemy” is the targets. Which will have collision detection and self moving.
